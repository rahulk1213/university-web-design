# university-web-design
This project is a demo university website created using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of the project is to practice front-end development and learn how to design and structure a responsive website.

The website is designed to represent the worldâ€™s biggest university with different sections that provide information about the institution. It includes a home page with an overview, an about page describing the university, a facilities page that highlights features such as the library, sports ground and cafeteria, and a contact page with an enquiry form and contact details.

The design is clean and simple. CSS flexbox and media queries are used to manage the layout and responsiveness, making sure the site adjusts to different screen sizes. The contact page also includes Google Maps integration to show the university location.

The project uses only HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling. There is no backend functionality, so the contact form is only for demonstration purposes.

To view the project, clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in a browser.

This project was created as part of learning front-end development and improving skills in HTML and CSS.
