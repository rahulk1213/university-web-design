                    When I first enrolled in the Certificate and Online Programs 2024, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But as I started attending the online classes, I realized how well-structured and student-friendly the program was. The flexibility of studying from anywhere gave me the freedom to balance my academics, personal life, and even part-time work. Each subject was explained with practical examples, and the recorded lectures helped me whenever I missed a live class. The certificate I earned is not just a piece of paper—it gave me real confidence, enhanced my resume, and made me feel prepared for future opportunities. This program has truly shaped my journey and I am grateful to be part of it
